                The UAE has strict pet import rules, and the process takes longer than most people expect — often four to six months from start to finish. The good news is that thousands of British expat families do it every year, and with the right preparation, it is completely manageable. This guide covers everything you need to know.

              The single biggest mistake UK expats make is leaving pet relocation too late. The rabies titre test alone requires a minimum 30-day wait after vaccination, followed by a further three-month waiting period before your pet can travel. If you are planning to move in six months, you should begin the process now.

            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
              Emirates Airlines does not carry live animals in the passenger cabin. Dogs and cats travelling from the UK to Dubai go as manifest cargo, handled by Emirates SkyCargo or a specialist pet freight company. British Airways also handles pet cargo on their London–Dubai route.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
              Small cats and very small dogs (under 8kg including carrier) may be able to travel in-cabin on other airlines via a connecting route, though this is complex to arrange. Most UK expats use a direct cargo service — it is the most reliable option.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
              Avoid travelling in the hottest months (June–September) if possible. Dubai airport can reach 45°C on the tarmac, and many airlines suspend live animal cargo during the summer heat period. Aim for October to April.

            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
              On arrival at Dubai International Airport, your pet will be inspected by Dubai Municipality veterinary officers. Have your original documents ready: the MOCCAE import permit, health certificate, vaccination record and microchip documentation. Inspections are usually straightforward if paperwork is in order.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
              Register your pet with Dubai Municipality within 30 days of arrival. This costs approximately AED 200 (£43) and requires annual renewal. Dogs must be licensed and microchipped — fines apply for unlicensed dogs found in public areas.

            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
              Dubai has good veterinary care. Recommended practices include Dubai Kennels and Cattery (DKC), Veterinary Hospital at Dubai Hills, and the British Veterinary Clinic in Jumeirah. Pet-friendly apartments are available but confirm with your landlord before signing — some buildings prohibit animals.

            <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
              &ldquo;I moved with a Labrador. The process felt overwhelming at first but once you break it into steps it is very manageable. The one thing I wish I&apos;d known earlier: use a specialist company. The MOCCAE portal and APHA process has enough moving parts that a professional who does this daily is worth every penny. My dog was at my new apartment in DIFC the same day I arrived.&rdquo;
