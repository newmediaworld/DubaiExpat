But it operates within rules that are very different from the UK. Understanding them is what separates expats who thrive socially from those who run into trouble.

                Non-Muslim UAE residents can apply for a personal liquor licence through MMI (Maritime and Mercantile International) or African+Eastern, the two licensed alcohol retailers. This allows you to purchase alcohol from their stores to consume at home. Since 1 January 2023 the licence has been <strong>free</strong> — Dubai Municipality dropped the fee at the same time as it suspended the 30% municipality tax on alcohol sales (5% VAT still applies). It is linked to your Emirates ID and can be applied for in the MMI or A&amp;E app. Without it, you technically cannot buy alcohol from a retail store. Apply once you have your Emirates ID.

            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
              If there is one social ritual that defines expat life in Dubai, it is Friday brunch. The UAE moved to a Saturday–Sunday weekend on 1 January 2022, with Friday a half-day for the federal public sector — but the brunch tradition stayed put on Friday, and many venues now run a Saturday sitting too. Friday brunch has evolved into a multi-hour extravaganza combining unlimited food, free-flowing drinks, and live music — typically running from noon to 4pm, often continuing informally until evening.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
              Almost every hotel and many licensed restaurants offer a Friday brunch package. Prices typically range from AED 250 to AED 700 per person (approximately £54–£150) depending on whether the drinks package is included and how premium the venue is. For UK expats used to pub lunches, it takes some adjustment — but most quickly come to love it.

Most operate as day-to-night venues — you arrive for sunbeds and swimming in the afternoon, and the DJ picks up as the sun goes down. Many charge an entry fee (AED 100–400) that is redeemable against food and drinks.

            <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
              Ramadan is the Islamic holy month of fasting and falls at a different time each year. During Ramadan, Dubai's social scene changes significantly. Alcohol service is typically restricted to evening hours only (after Iftar, the breaking of the fast at sunset). Music in many venues is turned off or significantly reduced during the day. Many clubs and entertainment venues close or operate reduced hours. Dress codes become stricter in public areas.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
              However, Ramadan is also a genuinely beautiful time to be in Dubai. Iftar dinners are magnificent — elaborate, sociable, and generous feasts that many expats consider among the highlights of their year. Most hotels offer special Ramadan tent dining experiences that are well worth attending.

            <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
              &ldquo;The first thing UK expats notice is that going out in Dubai is expensive by London standards — a round of drinks in a hotel bar will set you back AED 100–150 easily. The trick is learning the system: happy hours are real and generous (most hotel bars run 5–8pm with two-for-one deals), and once you know the right brunches and beach clubs your social life can be brilliant without breaking the bank. Irish Village on a Thursday night is as good as any pub in London and costs half the price.&rdquo;
