          <h2>How We Earn Revenue</h2>
          <p>
            Dubai Expat is a free resource for people relocating to Dubai and the UAE. To help support the cost of running the site and producing free guides, we may participate in affiliate programmes with companies and services that we believe may be useful to our readers.
          </p>

          <h2>Affiliate Links</h2>
          <p>
            Some links on this site are affiliate links. This means that if you click a link and make a purchase, sign up for a service, or complete another qualifying action, we may earn a commission at no extra cost to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            The price you pay is the same whether you use our affiliate link or visit the provider directly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Affiliate links may appear in articles, comparison tables, banners, buttons, or other content formats across the site. Not every affiliate link is individually labelled in every case.
          </p>

          <h2>Editorial Independence</h2>
          <p>
            Our affiliate relationships do not influence our editorial opinions, rankings, or recommendations. We aim to recommend products and services based on our own research and assessment of what may be most useful to our audience.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not recommend a product or service solely because it pays a commission.
          </p>

          <h2>Our Affiliate Partners</h2>
          <p>These are the affiliate programmes we currently participate in, and the links on this site that carry them:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Amazon Associates (UK)</strong> — general retail</li>
            <li><strong>GetYourGuide</strong> (via Awin) — tours and activities</li>
            <li><strong>Trip.com</strong> (via Optimise Media) — flights and hotels</li>
            <li><strong>SafetyWing</strong> — expat and travel medical insurance</li>
            <li><strong>NordVPN</strong> — VPN services</li>
            <li><strong>Incogni</strong> — personal data removal</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As an Amazon Associate we earn from qualifying purchases.
          </p>
          <p>
            Companies named elsewhere on this site are not necessarily affiliate partners. Where we recommend a provider we have no commercial relationship with — Wise, for example, in our money transfer guide — we say so in the article itself. This list may change as partnerships are added, removed, or updated.
          </p>
