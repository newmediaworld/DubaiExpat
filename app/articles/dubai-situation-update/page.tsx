                The British expat community in Dubai &mdash; roughly 240,000 strong before the conflict, including tourists &mdash; is having a conversation it never expected to have. Since Iranian strikes on the UAE began in late February 2026, the question isn&rsquo;t just &ldquo;is it safe?&rdquo; but something more personal: &ldquo;is this still where I want to be?&rdquo;
              </p>
              <p>
                People did leave. Around 30,000 British residents are estimated to have gone during the conflict &mdash; roughly one in eight of the long-term British population. But the majority stayed, most of those departures were always intended as temporary, and since the US&ndash;Iran interim agreement they have been coming back: families re-enrolling children in school, returning to in-person work, and picking up the routines they paused. One returning parent described it as &ldquo;like a big exhale&rdquo;. It is still too early to say how many of the 30,000 left permanently, but the direction of travel has clearly reversed.

              <p>
                For many long-term expats, leaving simply isn&rsquo;t straightforward. Their children are in school mid-term. Their mortgages or rental contracts are active. Their businesses employ local staff. Their spouse may hold a job that can&rsquo;t relocate. The social, financial, and professional ties that made Dubai home don&rsquo;t dissolve because the FCDO changes an advisory level.
              </p>
              <p>
                The sentiment among those staying tends to be cautiously optimistic. The UAE&rsquo;s air-defence systems have intercepted the overwhelming majority of incoming threats, and daily life in most residential areas continues largely uninterrupted. Schools remain open. Supermarkets are stocked. The metro runs on schedule. For many, the rhythm of life has adapted rather than stopped.
              </p>
              <p>
                The tech and entrepreneurial community has been particularly resilient. Many remote workers and startup founders report that their professional lives are essentially unchanged. Dubai&rsquo;s coworking infrastructure, fast internet, and business-friendly environment continue to function, and some see the current moment as an opportunity &mdash; lower rents, less competition, and a chance to demonstrate commitment to the market.

              <p>
                The expats who&rsquo;ve returned to the UK have their own compelling logic. For families with young children, the risk calculation is fundamentally different. Even if the statistical likelihood of harm remains low, the psychological burden of air-raid sirens and news alerts takes a toll that spreadsheets can&rsquo;t capture.
              </p>
              <p>
                Insurance became a significant practical issue while the FCDO advisory was in force between 28 February and 18 June 2026, because many international health and travel policies contain conflict-zone exclusions tied to government advice. For some expats, the moment their cover became uncertain was the moment the decision made itself. With the advisory lifted, those exclusions no longer trigger automatically &mdash; but insurers set their own terms, so check your policy wording rather than assuming cover is restored.
              </p>
              <p>
                Employers have played a role too. Several multinational companies with Dubai offices have offered voluntary relocation packages, and some have mandated the departure of non-essential staff. For employees in those positions, the company effectively made the decision for them.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is also a group of British nationals who want to leave but can&rsquo;t. Reports have emerged of expats on travel bans related to civil disputes &mdash; sometimes over relatively minor financial matters &mdash; who have been unable to exit the country. This has added an uncomfortable dimension to the safety conversation, highlighting the ways in which the UAE&rsquo;s legal system can restrict mobility in ways that have no equivalent in UK law.

                If you&rsquo;re reading this from the UK trying to work out what it&rsquo;s like on the ground, here&rsquo;s the honest picture: Dubai is running normally again. The malls and restaurants are busy, the Metro is on schedule, the beaches are back, construction crews are on site, schools have reopened and businesses are welcoming clients. Airspace reopened in May and the airlines have rebuilt their schedules. What remains is a sensible awareness of a region that has had a difficult year &mdash; the kind of practical vigilance any well-run city keeps after a disruption, rather than anything that shapes daily life.
              </p>
              <p>
                Restaurants and malls are open, though footfall has noticeably decreased in tourist-heavy areas like The Walk at JBR and Downtown. Brunches still happen. The gym is still busy at 6am. Kids still go to birthday parties. But people are paying more attention to the news. Conversations that used to be about property prices and school admissions now occasionally turn to flight availability and FCDO updates.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nightlife has taken a hit. Some venues have reduced their hours, and the atmosphere in areas like DIFC and Dubai Marina is quieter than usual. Tourism numbers are down significantly, which has a knock-on effect on the hospitality industry and the general energy of the city.
              </p>
              <p>
                One thing that multiple expats highlight is the information environment. The UAE restricts reporting on military matters, and social media posts about strikes or interceptions carry serious legal consequences. This creates an odd dynamic where significant events may be happening nearby but the public conversation about them is muted. For British expats accustomed to open media coverage, this can feel disorienting &mdash; and it&rsquo;s one of the main reasons British residents run a VPN day-to-day to reach BBC World Service, iPlayer and the FCDO&rsquo;s own travel service without geo-weirdness.

              <p>
                Money is a significant factor in the stay-or-go equation. Many British expats moved to Dubai for the tax advantages, and returning to the UK means stepping back into income tax, council tax, and a higher cost of living in many categories. For high earners and business owners, the financial cost of leaving can be substantial.
              </p>
              <p>
                Property markets have cooled but not collapsed. Rental prices in some areas have softened as departure-driven supply has increased, which creates an unusual opportunity for those arriving or those looking to move to a better apartment. Sale prices have been more stable, though transaction volumes have dropped.
              </p>
              <p>
                Job markets have contracted in some sectors, particularly tourism, hospitality, and retail. However, technology, finance, and professional services have been more resilient. Employers in these sectors report that they&rsquo;re still hiring, though candidate pools have shifted as some talent has relocated.

                The question on everyone&rsquo;s mind is: when will this end? Nobody has a reliable answer. The trajectory of the wider regional conflict will determine the security situation in the UAE, and that involves geopolitical forces far beyond anyone&rsquo;s control.
              </p>
              <p>
                What the British expat community in Dubai does demonstrate, though, is resilience. Whether people have stayed or left, the decisions have been thoughtful, personal, and based on individual circumstances rather than panic. That pragmatism is, in many ways, the defining characteristic of the community itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                For those considering a move to Dubai in the future, the current period is a useful reality check. Dubai&rsquo;s appeal &mdash; the lifestyle, the tax environment, the opportunity &mdash; hasn&rsquo;t disappeared. But the assumption that the Gulf would always be a geopolitically calm place to live has been challenged, and future expats will need to weigh that into their planning in a way that wasn&rsquo;t necessary before.
