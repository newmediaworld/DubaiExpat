                Since late February 2026, Iran has launched a series of ballistic missile and drone strikes against targets across the UAE and other Gulf states, in retaliation for Israeli&ndash;American military operations. The conflict has brought a reality that many expats never expected: air-defence interceptions audible at night, temporary airport disruptions, and a much-heightened security posture across Dubai.
              </p>
              <p>
                While the vast majority of incoming missiles and drones have been intercepted by UAE and allied air-defence systems, several high-profile sites in Dubai were struck in the early days of the conflict, including luxury hotels on The Palm. The UAE government has maintained that civilian safety remains its top priority and has invested heavily in expanded defence capabilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                For British nationals specifically, the situation carries additional complexities. Roughly a quarter of a million UK citizens live in the UAE, making them the largest European expat community in the country. Many have built lives, businesses, and families there over years or decades.

                The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) advised against all but essential travel to the United Arab Emirates from 28 February 2026, and lifted that advisory on 18 June 2026 following the memorandum of understanding signed the previous day. As of 20 August 2026 the FCDO does not advise against travel to the UAE. It does still warn of regional tensions, possible flight cancellations and periodic airspace closures, and notes that attacks could resume at short notice &mdash; so check gov.uk for the current position before you travel.
              </p>
              <p>
                The FCDO has also temporarily withdrawn dependants of British Embassy staff from the UAE as a precautionary measure, though the embassies in Abu Dhabi and Dubai continue to operate. British nationals in-country are encouraged to register their presence with the FCDO to receive direct updates.

              <p>
                One aspect of the situation that has caught many British expats off guard is the UAE&rsquo;s strict enforcement of cybercrime laws during the conflict. Dozens of foreign nationals, including a significant number of Britons, have been detained for filming or sharing footage of drone and missile interceptions on social media.
              </p>
              <p>
                Under UAE law, sharing images or videos related to military operations &mdash; even of something you witnessed from your balcony &mdash; can result in serious criminal charges. Reports indicate that some detainees have had their passports confiscated and face potential prison sentences.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is an important reminder that the UAE&rsquo;s legal system operates differently from the UK&rsquo;s. Laws around public expression, social media content, and criticism of the state are significantly stricter. British nationals should be extremely cautious about what they photograph, film, or post during the current period.

              <p>
                The picture on the ground is more nuanced than headlines might suggest. Many expats who have remained in Dubai describe the situation as &ldquo;functioning but tense.&rdquo; Shops, restaurants, schools, and offices continue to operate. The economy hasn&rsquo;t collapsed. Daily routines, for many, carry on.
              </p>
              <p>
                That said, the atmosphere has undeniably shifted. There is a heightened awareness that wasn&rsquo;t there before &mdash; the sound of interceptions at night, periodic disruption to flights, and a general sense that geopolitics is no longer something that happens somewhere else. Some expats describe feeling less carefree, particularly those with young children.
              </p>
              <p>
                The tech and business community has been particularly vocal about continuity. Many remote workers and entrepreneurs report that their professional lives have been largely unaffected. Dubai&rsquo;s internet infrastructure, coworking spaces, and business districts remain operational.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, significant numbers of Western nationals have left or are considering leaving. Reports suggest over 115,000 British nationals have returned to the UK since the conflict began, though many others have chosen to stay, citing strong community ties, financial commitments, and confidence in the UAE&rsquo;s defence systems.

              <p>
                Separate from the current geopolitical situation, Dubai&rsquo;s everyday safety record for expats remains strong. Street crime rates are exceptionally low compared to most major cities. Violent crime is rare, and petty theft is uncommon. Women report feeling safe walking alone at night in most residential areas &mdash; something that distinguishes Dubai from many Western cities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Road safety is one area where Dubai lags behind the UK. Traffic accidents remain a leading cause of injury, and driving standards can be erratic, particularly on major highways like Sheikh Zayed Road. If you&rsquo;re relocating, it&rsquo;s worth familiarising yourself with local driving habits and considering areas with good walkability or metro access.
              </p>
              <p>
                Heat-related illness is another consideration, particularly between May and September when temperatures regularly exceed 45&deg;C. This is a genuine health risk for people unaccustomed to extreme heat, especially those working outdoors or with young children.

              So Is Dubai Safe? Our Honest Take
            </h2>
            <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              <p>
                There&rsquo;s no single answer. Dubai before the Iran strikes and Dubai now are different propositions, and it would be irresponsible to pretend otherwise.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you&rsquo;re already in Dubai with an established life, strong community, and employer support, many expats are choosing to stay and report feeling relatively safe day to day. The UAE&rsquo;s air-defence systems have proven effective, and the government has made civilian protection a visible priority.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you&rsquo;re considering relocating to Dubai from the UK right now, the calculation has changed. The FCDO advisory against all but essential travel was lifted on 18 June 2026, so the insurance-validity and employer duty-of-care problems it created no longer apply automatically &mdash; but confirm your own policy wording, because insurers set conflict-zone exclusions independently of FCDO advice. The region does remain volatile: on 19 August 2026 two Iranian ballistic missiles were detected near the UAE, the second falling inside UAE territorial waters. Both were assessed as targeting maritime navigation, both fell into the sea, there was no land impact and no casualties, and the authorities confirmed the all-clear the same day. The honest summary is disrupted, not dangerous &mdash; flights between the UK and the Gulf are still being cancelled and rerouted, and that is the practical thing to plan around rather than a government warning that no longer exists.
              </p>
              <p>
                For those in the planning stages &mdash; researching visas, looking at schools, considering housing &mdash; there&rsquo;s no harm in continuing your research. The conflict will eventually de-escalate, and those who are well-prepared will be in the strongest position to move when conditions improve.

                    <strong>Check FCDO advice regularly</strong> &mdash; the situation is evolving, and advisory levels can change with little warning.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Keep your passport accessible</strong> and have a plan for departure if the situation deteriorates.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Be extremely careful on social media</strong> &mdash; do not film, photograph, or share images of any military activity, drone interceptions, or related incidents.
